<h3> Surface web vs Dark Web Vs Deep Web</h3>
<img align="left" src="deefsdd.jpg"width="50%" height="60%"><p>
The dark web and the deep web are often erroneously used interchangeably. To clarify: the deep web includes all the pages that don’t pop up when you run a web search. This covers everything requiring a login, such as personal email, online banking, or other such sites. Conversely, the dark web relies on encryption to keep irrefutably nefarious content anonymous.</p>
