<h3> What is the deep web?</h3>
<p>
The deep web is just like it sounds — below the surface and not completely dark.
</p>
<p>
Search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo are able to search and index websites because of links. They use links to rank search results according to things like relevancy, inbound links, and keywords. Regular browsers search the so-called “surface web,” but that’s where the search stops.
For instance, if you wanted to search a public library catalog to find a book, you couldn’t type the title into your browser’s search bar and expect Google to return a meaningful result for your library. That level of information would be located in the deep web.
</p>
<p>
The reason search engines can’t return this data to you is because there are no links. (Search engines crawl the internet by visiting one web page, then the links on that page, and then the links on subsequent pages.)
</p>
<p>
Instead, you would have to go to the public library’s website and use a search bar inside the website to locate this data on the library’s servers.
</p>
<p>
This kind of information is all over the internet. Almost every time you search internally on a website, you’re accessing deep web content.

<h3>What’s on the deep web?</h3>
<p>
The deep web holds the content that’s invisible to search engines. Here are a few examples of what’s on the deep web:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The content of your personal email accounts</li>
<li>The content of your social media accounts</li>
<li>The content of your online banking accounts</li>
<li>Data that companies store on their private databases</li>
<li>Content contained within scientific and academic databases</li>
<li>Medical records</li>
<li>Legal documents</li>
</ul>
<p>
A lot of what exists on the deep web consists of information that you probably wouldn’t want to turn up in a web search — like your checking account information — because it’s private and could be misused.
</p>
<p>
A rule of thumb: If you have to log in to one of your accounts by providing a user name, password, or some other type of authentication, the information you access is on the deep web.
That’s a good thing. The deep web can help protect your personal information and privacy.

<h3>Is the deep web safe?</h3>
<p>
The deep web is a pretty safe place, especially when you compare it with the dark web.
</p>
<p>
The dark web represents a sliver of the deep web. Dark web websites are often associated with illegal activity — but not all of them. More on that later.
</p>
<p>
Accessing content on the deep web is relatively safe. Think about it. You probably check your email and your credit card statements online without worry. But that doesn’t mean that accessing that personal information has no risks.
</p>
<p>
For instance, your accounts on the deep web contain a lot of your personal information that criminals might value. That’s one reason why it’s important to use strong, unique passwords on all your accounts. That might include a hard-to-guess combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.
</p>
<p>
Here’s another potential risk. You might be tempted to access your personal information on the deep web on an unprotected public Wi-Fi network. For instance, you might want to pay your bills while waiting to catch a flight at an airport.
</p>
<p>
But don’t do it on a public network. Instead, use a virtual private network — commonly known as a VPN — which can encrypt your data and help protect your online privacy.
Here’s one more risk. It’s also possible you could receive an email that appears to be from a reputable source. It might look like it’s from the IRS, for instance, an agency that keeps your personal information on the deep web. The email might ask you to supply your Social Security number to access your account or to click on a link to respond to a request for information.
</p>
<p>
Don’t do it. The IRS will never ask for your information through an email. That means someone is likely sending you an email to trick you into supplying valuable information. This is commonly referred to as "phishing."
</p>
<p>
While the deep web is relatively safe, it’s always smart to practice safe internet habit

<h3>Step to access the deep web:</h3>
<b>Step 1: To access the deep web, you need to have a Tor browser on your system.<br>
Step 2: First, Download Tor.<br>
Step 3: After downloading the Tor bundle, you need to install them on your system.<br>
Step 4: Click to open the downloaded file to start the installation process.<br>
Step 5: Follow the installation guide to complete the process.<br>
Step 6: Once you have installed Tor, open it.<br>
Step 7: Now, you can access the deep web using Tor browser.<br>
Step 8: This isn’t enough, your privacy is not completely secured. To double your security, you must have an advanced VPN service on the system that you access the deep/dark web.<br>
