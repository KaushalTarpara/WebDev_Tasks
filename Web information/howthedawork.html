<h3>* How the Dark Web Works</h3>
<p>
The dark web has become an online marketplace for illegal goods. Many of the innovations from legitimate online sellers like Amazon and eBay, like customer reviews and seller ratings, have been adopted to facilitate the sales of black market items.</p>

<p>The dark web attracts users who seek anonymity when conducting business. Intentions can be noble, such as with journalists seeking to interview citizens of repressive countries, where communications are monitored. Contrarily, the anonymity of the dark web attracts criminal actors like drug-dealers, hackers, and child pornography peddlers. There is also a growing service economy within the dark web in which hitmen and other illegal operatives advertise their services in ways they could not over traditional channels.</p>
