   <p> Search engines construct a database of pages on the Internet through the use of programs called web spiders. The spider receives a copy of each page and catalogues it, keeping the appropriate information for quick retrieval at a later date. When a new page is linked, it is eventually inspected by the spiders and added to the list of reachable pages; the surface Web.</p>

<p>
Any pages that cannot be found in the surface web manner are part of what is referred to as the deep web.</p>
