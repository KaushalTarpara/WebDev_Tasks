<h3 >  What is Dark Web ?</h3>
<p>
       You may have come across this name, mostly while browsing through Reddit or other discussion pages like Quora.</p>

    <p>   For some pages on the internet, it is not that simple to land on them. While the Deepnet covers up to 90% or even more of the www. There are sites that are not just set to “Noindex” but also are restricted to be found by any link or any of the standard search engines and browsers INTENTIONALLY. Although they come under the Hidden Web, this 0.1% of the darknet is only accessible through particular kind of software and tools.</p>
  <p>    This BlackNet area generally contains illegal content. Content like someone’s personal data, drug trafficking and other illicit activities. So, the law enforcement regularly shuts down and prosecutes sites and people performing illegal things on the darknet.</p>

<p>Overlay Networks can help you to get through this part of the invisible web. You need special software to access the Blacknet or Dark Web because a lot of it is encrypted, and most of these are hosted anonymously. The current most popular browser is the TOR. This community is many times referred to as the OnionLand. Other popular networks are Freenet, I2P, and Riffle operated by public organizations and individuals. And also may include small, friend-to-friend peer-to-peer networks.</p>
