<h3> What is the deep web?</h3>
<p>
The deep web is just like it sounds — below the surface and not completely dark.
</p>
<p>
Search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo are able to search and index websites because of links. They use links to rank search results according to things like relevancy, inbound links, and keywords. Regular browsers search the so-called “surface web,” but that’s where the search stops.
For instance, if you wanted to search a public library catalog to find a book, you couldn’t type the title into your browser’s search bar and expect Google to return a meaningful result for your library. That level of information would be located in the deep web.
</p>
<p>
The reason search engines can’t return this data to you is because there are no links. (Search engines crawl the internet by visiting one web page, then the links on that page, and then the links on subsequent pages.)
</p>
<p>
Instead, you would have to go to the public library’s website and use a search bar inside the website to locate this data on the library’s servers.
</p>
<p>
This kind of information is all over the internet. Almost every time you search internally on a website, you’re accessing deep web content.
