<h3 color="red">*What is the Surface Web? :- </h3>    
	<ul><li>	The Surface Web is also called “The Visible Web” or “Clearnet” or “Indexed Web” or “Lightnet”.</li>

<li>	Only 4% of information is visible. And it is 0.03% of the total internet.</li>

<li>It is the portion of the web that is available to the public.</li>

<li>	The Surface Web is searchable by the web search engines and it is crawlable.</li>

<li>	It is the opposite of the deep web.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also known as the Visible Web “LightNet”, or Indexed Web; Surface Web is everything that you can find on the regular World-Wide-Web. It contains the pages that are put under “Indexable” to be readily available to its searchers in any Search Engine’s Result Page.</p>

<p>According to the  worldwidewebsize.com, “The Web contains minimum 5.28 billion Indexed pages (Wed, 28 Nov’18).” Interestingly enough, the Surface Web is only approx. 10% of the whole World Wide Web.</p>

<p>Examples of Surface Web include- Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Regular Blogging Websites, and basically everything that we can see on any search engine’s result page (SERP).</p>

	       <p> Search engines construct a database of pages on the Internet through the use of programs called web spiders. The spider receives a copy of each page and catalogues it, keeping the appropriate information for quick retrieval at a later date. When a new page is linked, it is eventually inspected by the spiders and added to the list of reachable pages; the surface Web.</p>

<p>
Any pages that cannot be found in the surface web manner are part of what is referred to as the deep web.</p>


<font color="red"><h3>*Surface Web : :- </h3></font>

		    <p>  Essentially the visible web, that is, the Web as is it              is generally thought of: static websites (though many connect to Deep              Web databases, such as Amazon.com). Example of Surface Web pages                 mayinclude Google, Facebook, YouTube, the New York Times, and other               websites. Iffat & Sami provide an adequate                          
<br>       <h3> *working definition of the Surface Web:</h3>
                                            <p>  Surface Web is made up of static             and fixed pages, whereas Deep Web is made up of dynamic pages. Static             pages do not depend on a database for their content. They reside on a          server waiting to be retrieved, and are basically html files whose             content never changes. Any changes are made directly to the html code          and the new version of the page is uploaded to the server.</p> 
 
<p>Thus, any reference to Surface Web will be referring to common websites, that is, sites whose domains end in .com, .org, .net, or similar variations, and whose content does not require any special configuration to access.</p>

<p>A common image used to convey the meaning of Surface versus Deep Web is that of an iceberg: The visible portion of the iceberg represents a very small part of the whole (the whole in this case being the whole of the Internet, surface and deep web).The following pages will explain the Invisible Web (for our purposes, we’ll call this the Deep Web) further.</p>
