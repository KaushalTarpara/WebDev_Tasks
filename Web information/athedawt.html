<h3>Accessing the dark web with Tor browser</h3>

<p>Getting to the dark web is actually a lot easier than you might think. All you have to do is download a dark web browser, like the Tor browser.</p>

<p>Once you install a dark web browser on your device, it functions just like a regular browser: type in a URL, and off you go.
However, finding the material you’re looking for on the dark web is more difficult than using a search engine like Google. The dark web doesn’t have an index or ranking system to help you find what you need.</p>

<p>There are such things as dark web search engines. One called the Uncensored Hidden Wiki offers some guidance to content on the dark web, but it may include illegal websites.</p>
