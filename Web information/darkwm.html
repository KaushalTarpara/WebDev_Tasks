<h3 >  *   What is Dark Web ?</h3>
<p>
       You may have come across this name, mostly while browsing through Reddit or other discussion pages like Quora.</p>

    <p>   For some pages on the internet, it is not that simple to land on them. While the Deepnet covers up to 90% or even more of the www. There are sites that are not just set to “Noindex” but also are restricted to be found by any link or any of the standard search engines and browsers INTENTIONALLY. Although they come under the Hidden Web, this 0.1% of the darknet is only accessible through particular kind of software and tools.</p>
  <p>    This BlackNet area generally contains illegal content. Content like someone’s personal data, drug trafficking and other illicit activities. So, the law enforcement regularly shuts down and prosecutes sites and people performing illegal things on the darknet.</p>

<p>Overlay Networks can help you to get through this part of the invisible web. You need special software to access the Blacknet or Dark Web because a lot of it is encrypted, and most of these are hosted anonymously. The current most popular browser is the TOR. This community is many times referred to as the OnionLand. Other popular networks are Freenet, I2P, and Riffle operated by public organizations and individuals. And also may include small, friend-to-friend peer-to-peer networks.</p>

<h3>* What’s on the dark web?</h3>
<img  align="left"  src="dwm.jpg" width=" 50%"   height=" 100%"> 
<p>The dark web operates with a high degree of anonymity. It hosts harmless activities and content, as well as criminal ones.</p>

<p>For instance, one dark web website might provide complex riddles. Another might be a kind of book club that makes eBooks look more professional. Yet another might offer a forum for people who believe free speech is threatened.
But the dark web is better known for dark content — meaning, illegal and sometimes disturbing content. For instance, here’s a sample of illegal things you can find on the dark web.</p>

<p>Stolen information. When there’s been a data breach, there’s a chance the accessed information — from Social Security numbers to bank card numbers — will end up for sale on the dark web. You can also buy things like log-in credentials, hacked Netflix accounts, and more.
Illicit substances. Illegal drugs — and prescription drugs — are peddled on the dark web. You might also find toxic chemicals that can cause other types of damage.
<p>Disturbing and dangerous items and services. It can get ugly fast. Things like gore, murderers-for-hire, human trafficking, child pornography, body parts, counterfeit goods, and guns for sale can be found on the dark web.</p>
<p>In short, you can buy just about anything you can imagine — including things you’d probably be better off not imagining.

What makes it possible to do business on the dark web? Financial transactions use Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that helps assure buyers and sellers anonymity.

<h3>Is the dark web safe?</h3>
<p>The dark web may be safe in some cases — think, legitimate content — but not in others.</p>

<p>Here are a few safety issues to consider.<p>
<ul>
<li>Criminal element: There’s a chance you will find websites run by criminals. Beyond selling illegal goods and services, they may seek to exploit you and steal from you.</li>
<li>Breaking the law:You can be prosecuted for things you do on the dark web. It’s important to behave in an appropriate and legal manner.</li>
<li>Suspicious links: If you click on any links, you may be taken to material you might not want to see. It’s also possible that clicking a link or downloading a file could infect your device with malware.</li>
<li>Law enforcement: Law enforcement officials operate on the dark web to catch people engaged in criminal activity. Like others on the dark web, law enforcement can do their work under a cloak of anonymity.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to venture to the dark web, it’s smart to be selective about the websites you access.</p>

<h3>* How the Dark Web Works</h3>
<p>
The dark web has become an online marketplace for illegal goods. Many of the innovations from legitimate online sellers like Amazon and eBay, like customer reviews and seller ratings, have been adopted to facilitate the sales of black market items.</p>

<p>The dark web attracts users who seek anonymity when conducting business. Intentions can be noble, such as with journalists seeking to interview citizens of repressive countries, where communications are monitored. Contrarily, the anonymity of the dark web attracts criminal actors like drug-dealers, hackers, and child pornography peddlers. There is also a growing service economy within the dark web in which hitmen and other illegal operatives advertise their services in ways they could not over traditional channels.</p>

<h3>Accessing the dark web with Tor browser</h3>
<img  align="left"  src="tor2.jpg" width=" 50%"   height=" 60%"> 
<p>Getting to the dark web is actually a lot easier than you might think. All you have to do is download a dark web browser, like the Tor browser.</p>

<p>Once you install a dark web browser on your device, it functions just like a regular browser: type in a URL, and off you go.
However, finding the material you’re looking for on the dark web is more difficult than using a search engine like Google. The dark web doesn’t have an index or ranking system to help you find what you need.</p>

<p>There are such things as dark web search engines. One called the Uncensored Hidden Wiki offers some guidance to content on the dark web, but it may include illegal websites.</p>

<h3> *Dark Web Versus Deep Web</h3>
<p>
The dark web and the deep web are often erroneously used interchangeably. To clarify: the deep web includes all the pages that don’t pop up when you run a web search. This covers everything requiring a login, such as personal email, online banking, or other such sites. Conversely, the dark web relies on encryption to keep irrefutably nefarious content anonymous.</p>

<h3>The Size of the Dark Web Economy</h3>

<p>
In 2016, the Economist reported that drug activity fueled by the dark web grew from about $17 million in 2012 to approximately $180 million in 2015. However, these are mere estimations, as the very nature of the dark web makes it difficult to accurately gauge the economy it supports, including gun sales and other illegal transactions.<p><br>
