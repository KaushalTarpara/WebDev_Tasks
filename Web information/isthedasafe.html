<p>The dark web may be safe in some cases — think, legitimate content — but not in others.</p>

<p>Here are a few safety issues to consider.<p>
<ul>
<li>Criminal element: There’s a chance you will find websites run by criminals. Beyond selling illegal goods and services, they may seek to exploit you and steal from you.</li>
<li>Breaking the law:You can be prosecuted for things you do on the dark web. It’s important to behave in an appropriate and legal manner.</li>
<li>Suspicious links: If you click on any links, you may be taken to material you might not want to see. It’s also possible that clicking a link or downloading a file could infect your device with malware.</li>
<li>Law enforcement: Law enforcement officials operate on the dark web to catch people engaged in criminal activity. Like others on the dark web, law enforcement can do their work under a cloak of anonymity.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to venture to the dark web, it’s smart to be selective about the websites you access.</p>
