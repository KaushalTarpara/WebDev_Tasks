<h3>What’s on the deep web?</h3>
<p>
The deep web holds the content that’s invisible to search engines. Here are a few examples of what’s on the deep web:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The content of your personal email accounts</li>
<li>The content of your social media accounts</li>
<li>The content of your online banking accounts</li>
<li>Data that companies store on their private databases</li>
<li>Content contained within scientific and academic databases</li>
<li>Medical records</li>
<li>Legal documents</li>
</ul>
<p>
A lot of what exists on the deep web consists of information that you probably wouldn’t want to turn up in a web search — like your checking account information — because it’s private and could be misused.
</p>
<p>
A rule of thumb: If you have to log in to one of your accounts by providing a user name, password, or some other type of authentication, the information you access is on the deep web.
That’s a good thing. The deep web can help protect your personal information and privacy.</p>
